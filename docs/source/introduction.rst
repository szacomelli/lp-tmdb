Introduction
============
In this repository, we created a package of python modules in order to analyze the TMDB TV Shows Dataset.
You can find this data in `Kaggle <https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/asaniczka/full-tmdb-tv-shows-dataset-2023-150k-shows?resource=download>`_.
We have three main hypotheses:

1. TV Shows with less episodes have a higher vote average.
2. Networks have a tendency to have different favorite genres (a higher production rate of a specific genre).
3. Considering shows with similar vote averages, their popularities change based in their networks.

You can read about our analyses and our conclusions following the index bellow.
