Work Division
=============

The work division was made by the simplest way possible: 

* Everything that had to do with the first hypothesis was designed to Leonardo.
* Everything that had to do with the second hypothesis was designed to Sílvio.
* Everything that had to do with the third hypothesis was designed to Dilmar.

The Sphinx files was made by Sílvio, but the report itself was divided as above. The dataset was
encountered by Leonardo.
